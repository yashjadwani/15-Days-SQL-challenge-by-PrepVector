-- Question

Weâ€™re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.

Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold by purchasing additional products.

Note: If a customer purchased multiple products on the same day, it does not count as an upsell. An upsell is considered only if they made purchases on separate days

CREATE TABLE transactions (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
user_id INTEGER,
created_at DATETIME,
product_id INTEGER,
quantity INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO transactions (id, user_id, created_at, product_id, quantity) VALUES
(1, 101, '2024-01-01 10:00:00', 1, 1),  
(2, 101, '2024-01-01 14:00:00', 2, 1),
(3, 101, '2024-01-15 09:00:00', 3, 1), 
(4, 102, '2024-01-05 11:00:00', 1, 2),
(5, 102, '2024-01-05 11:30:00', 2, 1),
